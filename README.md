# OffTheShelf
## Project for HackTheShelf X FEMSA Ventures
A computer vision system that monitors retail shelf compliance with planograms in real-time. The system automatically detects missing products, sends alerts, and helps maintain optimal product placement. Using augmented reality, employees can visualize how the final planogram should appear on actual shelves at real-world scale.
